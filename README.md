# trendminer
Code from the Trendminder project I did for CURENT Spring 2017

This project came in several parts:

First, mine the data and then run sentiment analysis on it with Python.
The sentiment analysis was just me using a Python library: TextBlob. It returns a value between -1 and 1 when called on a string. The more positive the value, the more positive the sentiment.

The outcome of the Javascript and HTML/CSS stuff can be found <a href="seelab.eecs.utk.edu/trendminer">here</a>
